This is a project where I built a classification model using XG-Boost to categorize potential defaulers and non-defaulters from a test dataset after training with initial training dataset of customers from the Bank of Taiwan. 
Output from the model prddictions were then converted to CSV format and visualized using Power BI to determine the total monetary loss from credit card default on the Bank of Taiwan.
